# A-Simple-Traffic-Data-Analysis-Tool
traffic data analysis tool for the final project
This project aims to gather Internet traffic data from multiple locations at a range of times and provide meaningful
insights that will help Internet users optimise their Internet usage and/or make various decisions such as the choice
of Internet Serivce Provider (ISP). Insights derived can include metrics such as the number of hops, round-trip-time
etc. experienced from/to particular destinations by time-of-day and by ISP. Data can also be visualised based on
various categories such as type of application, geographical locations etc. Data can be gathered by using basic tools
such as ping and traceroute although a tool (e.g. a batch script at a minimum) that can automate the bulk-collection
and processing of data should be developed.
This project includes:
1.a batch script to catch traffic data
2.use python to deal with the collected data
3.use gnuplot to draw pictures and show to the users
